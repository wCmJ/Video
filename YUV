RGB color is tough to work with. if I need to lower the brightness uniformly on an image, I need to do it to all 3 colors.
There is a lot of redundancy in the data. To combat the redundancy, there is a different way of storing the info called YCbCr,
which breaks the signal down into a Y, or luminance channel, and 2 channels that store color info without brightness info
a Blue channel and a Red channel that don't contain any brightness.
a 8-bit YUV signal:
    Y:  0 - 255
    Cb: -128 - 128
    Cr: -128 - 128
    
most major video formats: MPEG-2, AVCHD, DVCPROHD, H.264, XDCAM - all use YUV color space.
the pixels are all stored using some variant of Y, Cb, Cr.
